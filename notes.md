## **Notes and Resources**

This code is ugly and not well organized but just a basic demo to make sure it would do what we needed. 


To-Dos:
- figure out how the hell to handle more than one user at a time with this interface
- more generally get this running on server (gradio likes nginx)
- meybe take advantage of ability to add custom css to get this looking a little nicer
- try to break it and see what needs to be buttressed
- Make better system for timing and also display how much time they have left
- Figure out input for giving specific directions ie creative vs well written vs practice, can we do this via dynamic links that maybe have their participant id as well so they dont even need to enter that ?
- Figure out exact method for using Llama3... Langchain?
- try to adjust the sizes of text boxes to be a little smaller so that more text is visible at once to make it a little easier to write whole essays
- pick a format for the data output, json probably?
